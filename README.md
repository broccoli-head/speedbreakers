# 🎮 Gameplay
In game, players need to avoid obstacles like asteroids, fireballs and fire clouds. The aim is to exceed the speed barrier - spaceships are becoming faster and faster through the gameplay. If the speed is enough, level changes (by exceeding the speed barrier, you are changing a planet).<br><br>
You can play cooperatively with your friend and try to get as far as you can, or competitively by attempting to get a better overall score than your oponent.
